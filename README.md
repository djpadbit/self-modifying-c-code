# Self modifying C code
### Only for linux for now but it should be easy to port to windows
This repo is just some tests of a self modifying code in C.
The code is commented.
Most of the original code comes from https://shanetully.com/2013/12/writing-a-self-mutating-x86_64-c-program/.
I just added some more stuff.
# To compile
```
gcc mod.c -o mod
gcc mod2.c -o mod2
```
